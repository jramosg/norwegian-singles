# 🇳🇴 Norwegian Singles Training Planner

A high-performance training plan generator based strictly on the **Norwegian Singles (NS)** methodology. Designed for runners who want to improve their aerobic threshold through science-backed, repeatable, and sustainable training blocks.

## 🏃‍♂️ What is Norwegian Singles?

The Norwegian Singles method is a training philosophy centered around lactate threshold management. Unlike traditional systems that push athletes to failure, NS prioritizes staying just below the threshold to maximize recovery and volume.

### Key Principles
- **⚡ Threshold Rules**: Quality work represents 20-25% of weekly volume.
- **🎯 Never to Failure**: Paces are conservative. You finish sessions knowing you could have done more.
- **⏱️ Short Recoveries**: 60-second breaks between intervals to maintain a steady lactate state.
- **🔄 Repeatable System**: 6-week blocks with a test on week 6 to recalibrate paces.

## 🚀 Target Distances
The application intelligently adapts training volume and interval structure based on your goal:
- **5K/10K**: Focus on race-pace specificity and short intervals.
- **Half Marathon/Marathon**: Increased aerobic base and longer threshold blocks.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Framework**: [Astro](https://astro.build/) (Static Site Generation + Islands Architecture)
- **Frontend**: [React](https://reactjs.org/) (Form logic & interactive Plan Viewer)
- **Styling**: Modern CSS variables, mobile-first design.
- **i18n**: Native Astro internationalization (English, Spanish, Korean,
  German, and French).
- **Architecture**: Clean separation between calculation logic (`lib`) and UI (`components`).

## 🧞 Commands

| Command | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `pnpm install` | Installs dependencies |
| `pnpm dev` | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321` |
| `pnpm build` | Build your production site to `./dist/` |
| `pnpm preview` | Preview your build locally |

## 💶 Monetization

Amazon links use locale-specific Associates tags from
`src/lib/affiliate.ts`. Confirm that every tag belongs to the intended
Associates account before deployment.

Affiliate and support clicks are recorded without cookies by Nginx. Inspect
them on the server with:

```shell
docker logs norwegian-singles 2>&1 | grep '^monetization '
```

Amazon Associates remains the source of truth for ordered items, dispatched
items, conversion rate, and commission income.

## 🧪 Methodology Details
- **VDOT Calculations**: Based on Jack Daniels' oxygen power formula.
- **Interval Structures**: 
  - **Short**: 3–4' (15K pace)
  - **Medium**: 6–8' (Half Marathon pace)
  - **Long**: 10–12' (≈30K pace)
- **Tapering**: Automatic adjustment for Race A (7-10 days) and Race B (3-4 days).
